# Boolean Algebra
## Basics you need to know:-
### A dash on lets say B is read as not B or complement of B , to use this in icarus verilog , while making a module for lets say a simple and gate , we will use ~B to specify not B or complement of B.
### Boolean algebra is useful in constructing logic gate truthtables without actually drawing or simulating them , its an expression made to make multiple calculations regarding gates easy.
### The miniterm form is addition of intersections , additive symbol or "+" is used for OR significance and a dot or "." is used for AND. It's easy once you go through some basic examples.
### While on a smaller scale it seems easy to sort and simplify boolean algebra , we have to consider that on a large scale for digital operations , simplifications might not be that easy with the help of distributive or additive laws... Hence there are various mappings we use.

# Digital-Logic-basics
First repo on digital electronics.

Started this repo to keep a track and maybe stay more conistent towards my 6 week progress of DE. I have already covered most of the basics from the DE and structure book by RP jain. I found it good for someone who is already familiar with basic transformation of gates and CMOS tech , am however lost at some points so i switched the book with Roger L. Tokheim â€“ Digital Electronics: Principles and Applications. 

## This repo was mainly created for DE + Asic stuff that goes on hand in hand, when you are working with asic special circuits , you need DE , but not the whole DE ... that's the reason if you want to learn DE as DE in it's own , refer books.

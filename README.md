# Digital-Logic-basics
First repo on digital electronics.
# Name - Dazai
Started this repo to keep a track and maybe stay more conistent towards my 6 week progress of DE. I have already covered most of the basics from the DE and structure book by RP jain. I found it good for someone who is already familiar with basic transformation of gates and CMOS tech , am however lost at some points so i switched the book with Roger L. Tokheim â€“ Digital Electronics: Principles and Applications. 
# Week 1 - Logic gates , Boolean Algebra and Number system (mainly binary , octa,hexa).

# Basic info regarding most of the gates is alr provided in lower classes. Go through them. 

# Intro to Practical TLL gates. (Ics)
### The popularity of ICs is due to it's inexpensive nature in most cases. The ICs are further seggragated into different families. It is said , ICs of same family behave like each other and are compaitable for interconnections. 
## Bipolar families of ICs. (bjt , etc.)
### The bipolar families use ttl logic for IC operation, TTL stands for transistor to trasnsistor logic. These use BJT , diodes ,etc. to have a set of prepared logic.
## MOS tech(Metal Oxide Semiconductor).
### The other group of ICs use this logic for connection. CMOS Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor,(COMOS) ICs contain parts comparable to insulated-gate field-effect transistors(IGFETs). The CMOS family is a very lowpower and widely used family using MOS technology.

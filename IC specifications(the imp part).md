# IC specifications and aplications 
###  We will study mainly about two families of ICs. But before that , lets go back a bit in our repo , we alr know about ttl and cmos logic families. When we overlap 2 ICs of the same familiy , their interface that is current - voltage regulation and impendance management is better than combining two diff family logic. 
### ICs have no meaning if they aren't compitable with real life devices , so we have to take care of the overlap of ICs with each other.
# TTL logic.
## Input and output characteristics.
### In a ttl logic IC, the input characteristic ranges from 0 (GND) to 5V (maxm) (Note - We are talking about 7404 TTL ic) and output ranges about the same.

The above attachement shows you the input-output that goes on beside dut.
# CMOS logic.
## We will study these types of ICs the old 4000 and the new 74C00 , 74ACT00 , etc.
### The more typical one or the oldest one being 4000 has higher operating voltage range whereas the newer one have relatively lower operating voltages. WHich is helping in interface of logic families. Following is the input-output operation :-

The 74HC00 series , also known as the low level cmos logic is mostly used these days.

### However , since we cant overlap TTL and CMOS logic there is a way to replace most of the TTL with CMOS logic , by setting up a "T" in CMOS , making a new branch of ICS the T operated CMOS logic ICs , these ICs are used as the replacement of TTL logic family. A voltage profile diagram for the 74HCTOO,74ACTOO, 74ACTQOO, 74FCTOO, and 74FCTAOO series CMOS ICs is attached below , you can see even if they share the cmos logic they are actually representing the high ;ow defination of that as a TTL logic family.

### In summary , the T cmos family has input logic as a TTL family and output one as a CMOS group.
